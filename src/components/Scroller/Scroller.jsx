          Rare Beauty is breaking down unrealistic standards of perfection. ​
          This is makeup made to feel good in, without hiding what makes you
          unique—because Rare Beauty is not about being someone else, but being
          who you are. We are on a mission to help everyone celebrate their
          individuality by redefining what beautiful means. We want to promote
          self-acceptance and give people the tools they need to feel less alone
          in the world. ​ Our vision is to create a safe, welcoming space in
          beauty—and beyond—that supports mental well-being across age, gender
          identity, sexual orientation, race, cultural background, physical or
          mental ability, and perspective.​ We believe in the beauty of
          imperfections. We nurture a caring, respectful community. ​ We create
          meaningful connections and relationships. ​ We champion authenticity
          and positivity. ​We lead with transparency to build trust. ​We believe
          there is power in being vulnerable. Our philosophy's purpose has
          always been to help women live better lives by taking small steps,
          every day , to be better for themselves. in this spirit we believe
          personal care should have a positive impact on the skin, the mind and
          the planet and are reinventing our portfolio to offer more
          eco-responsible, clean products that are multitasking yet gentle and
          offer a moment of wellbeing through scent and texture We created our
          clean program in response to consumer and retailer desire for
          ingredient transparency and to choose products based on the absence of
          certain ingredients, while maintaining safety and performance. Our
          clean list goes beyond authorities' requirements and some of our main
          competitors. It is dynamic and updated on a regular basis as consumer
          expectations evolve. we exclude parabens, phenoxyethanol, BHT,
          phthalates among others* in all our product launches starting in 2022
          and are working on reformulating our existing products to be in line
          with our clean standards
